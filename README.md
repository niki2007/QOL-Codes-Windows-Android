# Projects
I will be posting all of my Projects i made just for fun or for making something easier here. Feel free to download, use and edit them. 💜
All projects will have description on what they do and how they work everywhere *inside and outside the code*. 📓
> [!WARNING]
> **! Projects were tested on Windows 10 and some on Android devices. Not all of them will work on other devices without a change of the code. !** 

## Commiting
I work on my projects alone and for the time being, i won't have any people comminting to my projects. 🗒️

## Instalation
1. Download a project that you want.
2. For **.HTML** projects use any browsers when oppening them, and for any **.PY** *(python)* project use **Python Idle** when oppening them. 🐍
> [!NOTE]
> - Some Python codes might need some libraries to be installed. For that check the **project manual** how to install them.
> - Some projects might need to change the directory for function. ⤵️
3. After openning check the **project manual** or descrition directly in the project.
4. Enjoy 🐱

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - To have all HTML files look normal and good, download and put **style.css** in the same folders as other HTML codes.

> Feel free to edit anything in any code to make it better or work differentely. 🐟

> Everything is described in English 🦅🗽
