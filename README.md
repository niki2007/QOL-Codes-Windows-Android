# Projects
I will be posting all of my Projects i made just for fun or for making something easier here. Feel free to download, use and edit them.
> [!WARNING]
> ! Projects were tested on Windows 10 and some on Android devices. Not all of them will work on other devices without change of the code. !

## Commiting
I work on my projects alone and for the time being, i won't have any people comminting to my projects.

## Instalation
1. Download a project that you want.
2. For **.HTML** projects use any browser to open it, and for any **.PY***(python)* project use **Python Idle** to open it.
> [!NOTE]
> Some Python codes might need some libraries to be installed. For that check the **project manual** how to install them.
> Some projects might need to change the directory for function.
3. After openning check the **project manual** or descrition directly in the project.
4. Enjoy
> Feel free to edit anything in the code to make it better or work differentely.
