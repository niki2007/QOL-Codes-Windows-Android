# Name: Youtube Volume and Skip QOL

# Decription:
- This extention makes adjusting and changing videos much easier, and it also makes everything adjustable where Youtube itself can't. Example in Mini Player Mode, or Before even openning a video, or when looking at comments
- Adds 2 expandable transparent menus to Youtube in the top left corner. 
The 1st box expands a Volume bar that has very precise steps so you can adjust your volume exacly to your liking. 
The 2nd box shows 2 Buttons < and >. These buttons are exacly the same as "Previous" and "Next" video buttons on Youtube.


# Usage
After loading extention - Hover to top left to these 2small boxes and click and drag to adjust volume or click on the buttons to open next or previous video.

> - What made me make this: I needed a precise volume bar because when listening to music i couldn't get anything between 0% and 10%. Youtube just has very big steps and on a smaller UI + Resolution it didn't really work.
> - Tested on: Windows 10

> [!TIP]
> - Set your normal Youtube volume to extremely low and then adjust the extention one.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The volume will get saved localy.
> - If you don't want the skip buttons, past the code from **content_NoSkipButtons.txt** to **content.js**
> - Extention checks volume every 1second for update, can be adjusted but shouldn't be performance heavy.
> - Main Youtube volume can sometimes adjust to 100% and jumpscare you. (Only happened to me 2times in 4months)
